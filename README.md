# Mnemonic Bookmarks VSCode Extension

Mnemonic Bookmarks lets you set, jump to, list, and remove bookmarks in your code using memorable mnemonics.

## Features
- Set a bookmark at the current line with a mnemonic label
- List all mnemonic bookmarks in the workspace
- Jump to a bookmark by mnemonic
- Remove a bookmark by mnemonic
- Delete all bookmarks (with confirmation)
- Bookmarks follow code even if lines are added or removed above

## Usage
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
- Use commands:
  - `Set Mnemonic Bookmark`
  - `List Mnemonic Bookmarks`
  - `Go to Mnemonic Bookmark`
  - `Remove Mnemonic Bookmark`
  - `Delete All Mnemonic Bookmarks`

## Limitations
- Bookmarks are tracked by a snippet of the line's text. If the line is heavily edited or deleted, the bookmark may not move as expected.
- Bookmarks are stored per workspace.
